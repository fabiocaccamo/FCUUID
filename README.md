===================
iOS **UUID** library as alternative to the old good **UDID** and **identifierForVendor**.  
This library provides the simplest API to obtain **universally unique identifiers with different levels of [persistence](#persistence)**.  

It's possible to retrieve the **UUIDs created for all devices of the same user**, in this way with a little bit of server-side help **it's possible manage guest accounts across multiple devices easily.**

## Requirements & dependencies
- iOS >= 5.0
- ARC enabled
- Key-value storage enabled *(target / Capabilities / iCloud / Key-value storage)*
- Security.framework
- [UICKeyChainStore](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/UICKeyChainStore)
- ***(optional)*** - Key-value storage enabled -> Target / Capabilities / iCloud / Key-value storage enabled if you want to **share** `uuidsOfUserDevices` values **across multiple devices using the same iCloud account**.
- ***(optional)*** - KeyChain sharing enabled (entitlements and provisioning profile) if you need to **share** the same `uuidForDevice` / `uuidsOfUserDevices` values **across multiple apps with the same bundle seed**.

## Installation

#### CocoaPods:
`pod 'FCUUID'`

#### Manual install:
- Copy `FCUUID` folder to your project.
- Manual install [UICKeyChainStore](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/UICKeyChainStore)

### Optional setup:
It is recommended to do the setup in `applicationDidFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method.
- Add an observer to the `FCUUIDsOfUserDevicesDidChangeNotification` to be notified about uuids of user devices changes.
- If necessary, **migrate from a previously used UUID or UDID** using one of the migrations methods listed in the API section (it's recommended to do migration before calling `uuidForDevice` or `uuidsForUserDevices` methods). Keep in mind that **migration works only if the existing value is a valid uuid and `uuidForDevice` has not been created yet**.
- Call any class method to enforce iCloud sync.

## API
**Get different UUIDs** (each one with its own persistency level) 

```objective-c
//changes each time (no persistent)
+(NSString *)uuid;

//changes each time (no persistent), but allows to keep in memory more temporary uuids
+(NSString *)uuidForKey:(id<NSCopying>)key;

//changes each time the app gets launched (persistent to session)
+(NSString *)uuidForSession;

//changes each time the app gets installed (persistent to installation)
+(NSString *)uuidForInstallation;

//changes each time all the apps of the same vendor are uninstalled (this works exactly as identifierForVendor)
+(NSString *)uuidForVendor;

//changes only on system reset, this is the best replacement to the good old udid (persistent to device)
+(NSString *)uuidForDevice;
//or
# import "UIDevice+FCUUID.h"
[[UIDevice currentDevice] uuid];
```
**Get the list of UUIDs of user devices**
```objective-c
//returns the list of all uuidForDevice of the same user, in this way it's possible manage guest accounts across multiple devices easily
+(NSArray *)uuidsOfUserDevices;
```
**Migrate from a previously stored UUID / UDID**  
Before migrating an existing value it's recommended to **debug it** by simply passing `commitMigration:NO` and logging the returned value.  
When you will be ready for committing the migration, use `commitMigration:YES`.  
After the migration, any future call to `uuidForDevice` will return the migrated value.
```objective-c
//these methods search for an existing UUID / UDID stored in the KeyChain or in UserDefaults for the given key / service / access-group
+(NSString *)uuidForDeviceMigratingValue:(NSString *)value commitMigration:(BOOL)commitMigration;
+(NSString *)uuidForDeviceMigratingValueForKey:(NSString *)key commitMigration:(BOOL)commitMigration;
+(NSString *)uuidForDeviceMigratingValueForKey:(NSString *)key service:(NSString *)service commitMigration:(BOOL)commitMigration;
+(NSString *)uuidForDeviceMigratingValueForKey:(NSString *)key service:(NSString *)service accessGroup:(NSString *)accessGroup commitMigration:(BOOL)commitMigration;
```
**Check if value is a valid UUID**
```objective-c
+(BOOL)uuidValueIsValid:(NSString *)uuidValue;
```

**(persists only if the user have not uninstalled all apps of the same vendor)*

***(persists only if the user restores a device backup which includes also keychain's data)*

## FAQ
#### How can I share the device uuid between two apps?
You must have **KeyChain sharing enabled** (entitlements and provisioning profile) and your apps identifiers must have the same bundle seed.

#### What happens if I call `uuidForDevice` on 2 different devices using same iCloud account and iCloud Keychain?
You will obtain 2 **different uuid(s)**, and if you call `uuidsOfUserDevices` you will obtain a list containing the uuids of both devices.

#### When I reboot / upgrade / reset my device system, will device uuid change?
Please check the **persistence** table above.
